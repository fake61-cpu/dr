    <title>Load Balancing Simulation</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Theory</h2>
<p>
Load balancing distributes network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and improve performance, reliability, and resource utilization.
Two common algorithms used are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Round-Robin:</b> Assigns requests to servers in a cyclic order; simple and effective when servers have equal capacity.</li>
    <li><b>Least-Connection:</b> Sends new requests to the server with the fewest active connections; ideal for uneven workloads and ensures balanced utilization.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Short Code Explanation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><code>ServiceInstance</code> represents a backend server handling requests.</li>
    <li><code>RoundRobinLoadBalancer</code> stores service instances and assigns requests in cyclic order.</li>
    <li><code>get_instance()</code> selects the next available instance using a rotating index.</li>
    <li>The script simulates 10 incoming requests and distributes them using the round-robin logic.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
In this practical, we successfully implemented a load balancing simulation using the Round-Robin algorithm in Python. The program evenly distributed incoming requests among multiple service instances in a cyclic manner, ensuring that no single server was overloaded. This demonstrated how load balancing enhances system performance, resource utilization, and reliability.
