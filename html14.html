        <h1>Understanding Basic Concepts of Microsoft Azure</h1>

        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform by Microsoft that provides services such as compute power, storage, 
            networking, artificial intelligence, analytics, and application hosting. With Azure, users can build, deploy, and 
            manage applications without needing physical hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            Azure is widely used because it is scalable, cost-effective, globally available, and supports multiple programming 
            languages and operating systems. It is useful for students, developers, and organizations to host applications, run 
            virtual machines, manage databases, and build AI-based solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Azure Portal serves as a web-based interface where users can create, configure, and monitor cloud resources. 
            Before accessing it, users must create and verify an Azure account.
