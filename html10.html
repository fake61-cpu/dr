    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>
        A Service Level Agreement (SLA) in cloud computing defines performance expectations such as 
        uptime and response time between a provider and user. SLA monitoring helps ensure services 
        meet these standards by measuring performance and detecting failures or slow responses.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this practical, a Python script is used to monitor service response times using the 
        <code>requests</code> module. Each endpoint is tested, and the response time is compared with 
        a predefined threshold. If the response time is within the limit, the service meets the SLA; 
        otherwise, it is marked as a breach.

    <h2>Short Code Explanation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A list of service URLs is defined.</li>
        <li>A response time limit (threshold) is set.</li>
        <li>The script sends requests to each URL and measures time taken using <code>time.time()</code>.</li>
        <li>It prints response status and checks whether it meets or violates the SLA.</li>
        <li>Errors are handled using a <code>try-except</code> block.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This experiment demonstrated how to monitor SLA compliance by checking the response time of 
        different endpoints. The script successfully identified which services met the performance 
        threshold and which did not, showing how SLA monitoring helps maintain reliable and 
        high-performing cloud services.
